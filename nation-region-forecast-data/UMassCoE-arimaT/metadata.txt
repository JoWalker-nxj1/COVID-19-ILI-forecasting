methods: >- An ARIMA model is fit using the auto.arima function in the forecast
  package for R.  The data are log-transformed and any infinite or missing
  values after the transformation are linearly imputed before fitting the
  model.  A separate model is fit for each region.  Through iterating the
  one-step-ahead predictions, this model fit yields a joint predictive
  distribution for incidence in all remaining weeks of the season.  Appropriate
  integrals of this joint distribution are calculated via Monte Carlo
  integration to obtain predictions for the seasonal quantities.  For making
  prospective predictions for each season, only data before the start of that
  season were used in fitting model parameters.
